# Platonic Solids

I AM NOT ACTUALLY WORKING IN THIS REPOSITORY, ANYWAY, YOU CAN SEND ME ANY DOUBT AT MY TWITTER. 

In this repository, I code in POV-Ray how to build the 5 platonic solids: cube, octahedron, tetrahedron, icosahedron, and dodecahedron.

How I SUGGEST to read them:

First the cube. Here I explain more about my code and is the base for the other solids.

Next you should open the tetrahedron and octahedron
